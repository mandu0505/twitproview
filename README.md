- **Twitter Profile Tweets Listing Platform**
- A service that helps Twitter users view a specific user's timeline more easily.

# 📝 Summary

Social media **Twitter**, which is popular with more than 100 million active users per day, did not have many ways to list specific users' tweets in the latest order and like order. Therefore, I made a platform to make it easy to see users' latest or popular tweets without restrictions. If you enter the Twitter user's ID, it is a service that shows the user's timeline and lists tweets in several ways.

# ⭐️ Key Function

- **TwitProview (Twitter Profile Viewer)**
- After entering the UserID, you can view the user's timeline and tweets.
- You can search by changing the order of tweets listing through the short option on the timeline.
- **Twitter Trends**
- You can see Twitter trends in many countries around the world in real time and in your current location.
